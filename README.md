# Epidemiology of Breast Cancer: A Supervised Learning Approach

## Project Overview

This project applies supervised learning techniques to analyze breast cancer data. We aim to predict breast cancer diagnoses and identify key factors contributing to breast cancer risk. The project utilizes various machine learning models and data analysis techniques to achieve these goals.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database. It includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, describing characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Model performance comparison and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Loaded and preprocessed the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted statistical analysis and visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships.
3. **Model Development**: Implemented and trained multiple supervised learning models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compared models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Feature Importance**: Analyzed which features are most significant in predicting breast cancer.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for development and presentation

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy in breast cancer prediction across multiple models
- Identified key features that are most indicative of malignant breast cancer
- Provided insights into the epidemiology of breast cancer through data analysis

## Future Work

- Incorporate more advanced machine learning techniques like ensemble methods or deep learning
- Expand the dataset with additional patient information for more comprehensive analysis
- Develop a user-friendly interface for medical professionals to utilize the predictive models
